Find the most prolific author of github issues, and I want to see all of their issues and comments

I will need to see ONLY the author, title, and comments. HTML elements can be styled using twitter bootstrap css.

Show only the comments by the author of the issue.

Use accordion style display to group comments.

Give me a separate text below the comments to go to the actual issue on github.
My GitHub repo is breba-apps/TempRepo.
