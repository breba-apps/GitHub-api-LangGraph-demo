Show me all issues that I can comment on.
For each issue Show the following:
1. List of all comments on that issue
2. A text box and a button.
The button will submit this comment to an issue.

When you press the button, it should make a request to http://127.0.0.1:5001/act
The payload should include the text of the textbox, the github issue id, and be presented as a prompt to another agent.
It needs to explain to the Agent that we are commenting on the issue.

At the bottom of the page have a status bar that shows response from the "/act" endpoint

The "/act" endpoint takes in a plain text prompt that looks like this:
Write a comment for the issue.
Issue ID: 2, Comment: hello

The response from the "/act" endpoint is HTML, not JSON
