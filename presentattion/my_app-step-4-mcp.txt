Background
I'm organizing a hackathon. 
Pleople are submitting their hacks to a GitHub repo using GitHub Issues.
Here is the GitHub Repo : https://github.com/breba-apps/TempRepo
The reviewers for the submitted hacks are:
yasonk
scarlettej
sydneys

Now do the following:
Find the last 10 open submissions.

For each submission make sure to display:
issue labels,
project repo,
demo video link,
deployed application url

Also for each issue create a dropdown with the names of the reviewers.

A button to submit the reviewer will be used to update the issue on GitHub.
Make sure to specify that the button modifies the "assignee" for the given GitHub issue.

Don't make up links or any other content, just use the data provided.

Use tailwind CSS to make it look good.
