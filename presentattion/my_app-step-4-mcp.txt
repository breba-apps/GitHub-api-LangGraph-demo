Background
I'm organizing a hackathon. 
Pleople are submitting their hacks to a GitHub repo using GitHub Issues.
Here is the GitHub Repo : https://github.com/breba-apps/TempRepo

The reviewers for the submitted hacks are:
yasonk
scarlettej
sydneys

Now do the following:
Find the last 10 open submissions.

For each submission make sure to display:
Current Assignee (don't make one up, pull from the "assignees" field only)
issue labels,
project repo,
demo video link,
deployed application url

Also for each issue create a dropdown with the names of the reviewers.

A button to submit the reviewer will be used to update the issue on GitHub.
Make sure to specify that the button modifies the "assignee" for the given GitHub issue.
If assignment is successful also update the relevant field for that issue on the page.

Don't make up links or any other content, just use the data provided.

Use tailwind CSS to make it look good.
