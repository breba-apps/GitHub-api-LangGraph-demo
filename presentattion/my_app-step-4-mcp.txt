Background
I'm organizing a hackathon. 
Pleaple are submitting their hacks to a repo as Github Issues.
Here is the Github Repo : https://github.com/breba-apps/TempRepo
The reviewers for these submitted hacks are:
yasonk
scarlettej
sydneys

Now do the following:
Find the last 10 open submissions. 

For each submission make sure to display labels, project repo, and demo video link, if they exist. 
Also for each issue create a dropdown with the names of the reviewers.
A button to submit the value will be used to update "assignee" for the issue on github.
The button will send the payload to the "/act" endpoint.
Make sure to specify in your instructions to the "/act" endpoint to update the "assignee" field in GitHub"

Don't make up links or any other content, just use the data provided.
