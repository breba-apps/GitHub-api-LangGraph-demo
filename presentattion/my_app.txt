Find the most prolific author of github issues, and I want to see all of their issues and comments

I will need to see ONLY the author, title, and comments. HTML elements can be styled using twitter bootstrap css.

I want to see the comments in an acordion style dropdown.

Give me a link to each issue. My repo is breba-apps/TempRepo
