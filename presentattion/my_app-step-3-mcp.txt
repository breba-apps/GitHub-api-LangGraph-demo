Given my repo: https://github.com/breba-apps/TempRepo
Find the most prolific author of github issues, and I want to see all of their issues and comments.

Make sure to show only comments by the author of the issue.
Bellow the comments, include a link to the issue on GitHub. 

I will need to see ONLY the author, title, and comments. 
HTML elements can be styled using bootstrap css.
For convenience use accordion style display to make it easier scroll through the entries.
