Given my repo: https://github.com/breba-apps/TempRepo
Find the most prolific author of GitHub issues, and I want to see all of their issues and comments.

Make sure to show only comments by the author of the issue.
Below the comments, include a link to the issue on GitHub.

I will need to see ONLY the author, title, and comments. 

Style:
HTML elements can be styled using bootstrap css.
Use accordion style display to make it easier scroll through the entries.
